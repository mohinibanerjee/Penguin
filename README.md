This is a simple game where the objective is to move the penguin to the  portal <br> at the bottom right corner using the arrow keys. However, you must avoid the <br> blocks, or else the game will automatically be over since the penguin wil crash <br>and die. As a bonus, the penguin can eat the fish by moving the penguin over the <br>fish. This game was developed over a weekend at a hackathon at Paypal <br>(http://www.hshacks.com/) Have fun!");
